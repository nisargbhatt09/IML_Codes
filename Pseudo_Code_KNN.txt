1. Choose the number of neighbors, k.

2. For a new data point to be classified:

   1. Calculate the distance from the new data point to all points in the training dataset.
      - Common distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, etc.

   2. Sort the distances in ascending order.

   3. Select the top k points from the sorted list.

   4. For classification:
      - Count the number of data points in each category among the k neighbors.
      - Assign the new data point to the category where you counted the most neighbors.

   5. For regression:
      - Compute the average or median of the numerical target of the k neighbors.
      - Assign this averaged/median value to the new data point.

3. Return the category (for classification) or value (for regression) for the new data point.
